    description: "Understanding the Wildfire Soaking System's capabilities",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What makes the Wildfire Soaking System smart and reliable?",
        answer:
          "The system features a rugged, waterproof cabinet with a custom Arduino Opta controller, advanced automation, and multi-layer connectivity. It's built to function reliably in wildfire-prone environments.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does the system stay powered during an outage?",
        answer:
          "It uses a standard outlet as primary power, with a 25Ah lithium battery that provides 2â€“3 days of backup. Automatic switching ensures a seamless transition, and optional solar or generator add-ons can extend backup power.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if Wi-Fi goes down?",
        answer:
          "The system stays connected using a backup Blues cellular module, ensuring remote access and automation even if Wi-Fi is lost.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does the system know when to activate?",
        answer:
          "It uses live NASA wildfire data and activates automatically when a fire is detected within your chosen trigger radius (e.g., 15 km).",
      },
      {
        question: "What can I control and monitor?",
        answer:
          "Using the Chiliwap web platform or the local controller, you can manage valves and pumps, schedule soaks, monitor flow, pressure, and temperature, check water levels, view live camera feeds, and receive system alerts.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is the system customizable?",
        answer:
          "Yes. It's highly adaptable with optional add-ons like cameras, tank level sensors, digital gauges, extra pumps or zones, and smart home integrations.",
      },
      {
        question: "What comes with the system?",
        answer:
          "Standard components include an Arduino Opta controller with cellular backup, power supply, lithium battery, solenoid valves, DIN-mounted parts, and a 2' x 2' irrigation valve box.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Rainwater",
    description: "Using rainwater for wildfire protection",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How does the system collect and store rainwater?",
        answer:
          "The Wildfire Soaking System can be integrated with a rainwater harvesting setup. Rainwater is collected from your roof and directed into storage tanks through a filtration system to remove debris and contaminants.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the benefits of using rainwater?",
        answer:
          "Rainwater is a sustainable and cost-effective water source. It reduces reliance on municipal water, lowers utility bills, and provides a dedicated water supply for wildfire protection. Even a modest tank can hold the equivalent of two wildfire helicopter buckets.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I customize the rainwater system?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We offer a range of tank sizes, filtration options, and integration features. You can choose above-ground or buried tanks, add UV filtration for potable use, and connect the system to irrigation or greywater reuse setups.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does rainwater support wildfire defense?",
        answer:
          "Stored rainwater can be used to power the Wildfire Soaking System during emergencies, ensuring your home has a reliable water source even if municipal supply is disrupted. This enhances resilience and self-sufficiency during fire season.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Maintenance & Support",
    description: "Ensuring your system runs smoothly and efficiently",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How often should I service the system?",
        answer:
          "We recommend testing the system annually and draining it before winter if it has been activated.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if something breaks?",
        answer:
          "Our team is available for support and repairs. We can also provide replacement parts or upgrades.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I start or stop the system?",
        answer:
          "You can activate or deactivate the system from your phone, computer, or the controller at your home.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I test the system without activating a full cycle?",
        answer:
          "Yes, the system includes a test mode for safe and quick checks.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer maintenance plans?",
        answer:
          "Yes, we offer optional maintenance packages that include annual inspections, winterization, and system updates.",
      },
